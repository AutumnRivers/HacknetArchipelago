 <DeadMansHand> i looked around for pete and he must've chickened out before me and stumbled home or something heh
 <DeadMansHand> What'd he say when he woke up this morning?
 <Thirteen-> uhh.. he hasn't come home yet.. i thought he was staying with you?

DragonflyBlade21: A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.

<JonJonB> Purely in the interests of science, I have replaced the word "wand" with "wang" in the first Harry Potter Book
 <JonJonB> Let's see the results...

 <JonJonB> "Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry.
 <JonJonB> "Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wang in half an' everything

 <JonJonB> A magic wang... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.

 <JonJonB> "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wang. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wang for charm work."
 <JonJonB> "Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wang. Eleven inches. "

 <JonJonB> Harry took the wang. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wang above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls

 <JonJonB> "Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wang, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!"

 <JonJonB> The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wang had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.

 <JonJonB> He bent down and pulled his wang out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

 <JonJonB> He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wang, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wang at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.

 <JonJonB> Ok
 <JonJonB> I have found, definitive proof
 <JonJonB> that J.K Rowling is a dirty DIRTY woman, making a fool of us all
 <JonJonB> "Yes," Harry said, gripping his wang very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear his mother again... but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn't want to... or did he?
 <melusine > O_______O
 <JonJonB> Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wang

 <JonJonJonB> Then, with a sigh, he raised his wang and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.

 <JonJonJonB> 'Get - off - me!' Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncles sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wang.

<wolf> 1. Save every Free Credit Card Offer you get, Put it in pile A 
 <wolf> 2. Save every Free Coupon You get, put that in pile B 
 <wolf> 3. Now open the credit card mail from pile A and find the Business 
        Reply Mail Envelope. 
 <wolf> 4. Take the coupons from pile B and stuff them in the envelope you hold 
        in your hand. 
 <wolf> 5. Drop the stuffed to the brim envelopes in your mail and walk away 
        whistling. 
 <wolf> I have now received two phone calls from the credit card companies 
        telling me that they received a stuffed envelope with coupons rather 
        then my application. They informed me that it they are not pleased that 
        they footed the bill for the crap I sent them. I reply with "It says 
        Business Reply Mail" I'm suggesting coupons to you to ensure that your 
        business is more successful. They promptly hang up on me. 
 <wolf> Now, I did this for about a month before it got boring, so I got an 
        added idea! I added exactly 33 cents worth of pennies to the envelope 
        so they paid EXTRA due to the weight. I got a call informing me about 
        the money, I said it was a mistake and I demanded my change back. After 
        yelling at the clerk and then to the supervisor they agreed to my 
        demands and cut me a check for the money. I hold in my hand at this 
        very moment a check from GTE Visa for exactly 33 cents.

<third_planet> The other night my friend had some pot and wanted me to smoke it with him, but we had nowhere to smoke it because both our parents were home.
 <third-planet> So we drove around looking for a place to park so we could smoke in the car.
 <third-planet> We eventually settled on a Wendys parking lot..
 <Mr-Butlertron> The logic is all there...
 <third-planet> I know, it was a ridiculous idea. We were just desperate and that was the first place to pull off..
 <third-planet> So we park in the back of the parking lot under this tree, and it's dark out, so we figure we're secluded enough. We start to light up and a cop pulls in. So we both sit really still and hope the cop will think the car is empty and just parked there. Or that he won't notice.
 <third-planet> The cop circles the parking lot once, then parks behind us and we're both freaking out. So Bobby, my friend, takes all the pot and shoves it in the glove compartment. But the car smells like pot, so we figure we're busted. 
 <third-planet> So Bobby says we've gotta distract the cop from the pot. In a huge flash, he rips his shirt off, undoes my pants and sticks his hand inside. Before I can process what's happening, the cop knocks on my window. Then he looks in and sees Bobby shirtless, with his hand down my pants and turns bright red. 
 <third-planet> I roll my window down and the cop says in this really flustered voice, his face bright red, "you guys be good now" and walks quickly back to his car and drives off.
 <third-planet> He didn't even notice the smell of pot.
 <third-planet> We drove home in the most uncomfortable fucking silence ever.

IronChef Foicite: well, there's a lot of reasons
 IronChef Foicite: i mean, roses only last like a couple weeks
 IronChef Foicite: and that's if you leave them in water
 IronChef Foicite: and they really only exist to be pretty
 IronChef Foicite: so that's like saying
 IronChef Foicite: "my love for you is transitory and based solely on your appearance"
 IronChef Foicite: but a potato!
 IronChef Foicite: potatos last for fucking ever, man
 IronChef Foicite: in fact, not only will they not rot, they actually grow shit even if you just leave them in the sack
 IronChef Foicite: that part alone makes it a good symbol
 IronChef Foicite: but there's more!
 IronChef Foicite: there are so many ways to enjoy a potato! you can even make a battery with it!
 IronChef Foicite: and that's like saying "i have many ways in which I show my love for you"
 IronChef Foicite: and potatos may be ugly, but they're still awesome
 IronChef Foicite: so that's like saying "it doesn't matter at all what you look like, I'll still love you"

 <Montana> OMFG my naked sister just ran into my room and she set fire/other means of destruction to my room but because Im a total geek it doesnt occur to me to get of irc and fix it. 
 <Montana> I instead enter a conversation on computers: OMG MY COMPUTER HAS GOT A VIRUS! OH WAIT NO, ITS WINDOWS/LINUX/MAC/NORTON/AOL. Now for the obligatory Windows ME insult where the name of the product is mistaken for a pronoun for myself:
 <Montana> ME SO GAY! WHOOPS IT LOOKS LIKE THE INTENDED PURPOSE OF THAT STATEMENT WAS TO HIGHLIGHT MY OWN HOMOSEXUALITY WHEREAS I MEANT IT TO BE THE HOMOSEXUALITY OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM! HOW EMBARASSING!
 <Montana> Now for the topic of sex:
 <Montana> I HAVE A GF.. AND BY GF I OF COURSE MEAN A GFORCE 20MB 3.45 SYSTEM RETRO POWER MAX SUPERMAN RAPING COMPUTER STICK!
 <Montana> Furthermore, I make a comment as to the worth of sex but comment of my lack of sexual activity.
 <Montana> Hmm
 <Montana> I'm forgetting the most impostant part! The lack of social interaction!
 <Montana> OMG I just opened my blinds and the sunlight burnt and I saw this guy with a swollen chest and I was like WTF and my dad says 'thats called a girl' im like WTF IS A GIRL then i went and downloaded 50GB of porn.
