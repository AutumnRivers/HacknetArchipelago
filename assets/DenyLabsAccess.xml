        <body>Whoops! You can't access the Kaguya Trials yet -- you're missing some items.

Check your Archipelago tracker, and make sure you have the following items:
- Kaguya Trials Access
- TorrentStreamInjector
- FTPBounce and/or FTPSprint

If you're missing anything above, sorry! You're gonna have to wait to access Labyrinths until you've found those.

If you do have everything listed above and you're still getting this e-mail, then it sounds like I messed up! I am a raft floating on an ocean of pure shame.
Save your game, report this as a bug, and include your save file. Additionally, including your Archipelago session spoiler log would also be immensely helpful.

Happy travels!
